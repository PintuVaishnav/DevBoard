## 🎯 Goal of this project

The mission behind **DevBoard** is to build a minimal yet powerful workspace for developers and DevOps engineers. Here’s what this project aims to achieve:

1. **Boost Developer Productivity & Focus**  
   DevBoard is designed to reduce tab chaos and context switching. Whether you're managing a tech stack, tracking deployments, or planning your next feature — everything lives here.

2. **Centralize Project & DevOps Monitoring**  
   From Docker containers and K8s pods to Helm services and CI/CD pipelines, DevBoard acts as your personal command center. It also integrates with GCP and will soon support AWS.

3. **Visualize Your Infra & Cost**  
   Track cloud usage and GCP infrastructure costs in real time. Understand what's running, where, and how much it costs — saving hours of manual digging.

## 🔧 Why DevBoard? Real-World DevOps Problem — Solved.

In real-time production environments, DevOps engineers often juggle multiple tools like:

- 🐳 Docker  
- ☸️ Kubernetes  
- ⎈ Helm
- 🔄CI/CD Pipelines  
- 💻 Services & Deployments  
- ☁️ GCP Infra Monitoring  
- 💸 Billing Dashboards  

Switching between different tabs and tools becomes overwhelming.

### ✨ **DevBoard changes that.**

It’s a unified platform where:

- ✅ **All DevOps tools** (Docker, K8s, Helm, Services, Deployments,Pipelines) can be monitored from one place.  
- ✅ **GCP infrastructure** usage and cost data is visualized.  
- ✅ Future support for **AWS billing and infra** is coming soon.  
- ✅ It **saves time** and increases productivity for DevOps engineers.  
- ✅ Acts as a **real-time control center** for your workflow.  

> 💡 Whether you're checking pod status, infra cost, or deployment state — DevBoard keeps you focused on what matters.
